title: What Ceph Storage for OpneStack Private Cloud ?
---

> **What is Ceph ?**

 Ceph is an open source project that provides software-defined storage with unified (object, block, and file) storage. You can scale out this storage, and it is self-healing with the ability to anticipate failures.
 Ceph is a free, open-source storage platform that operates in a distributed manner, without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely available. Ceph replicates data and makes it fault-tolerant using commodity hardware, thus delivering highly cost-effective storage capabilities

  Ceph is often deployed with OpenStack as a back-end storage method. These two open source projects work together to make a well-integrated and robust solution for infrastructure.

> **How Ceph and OpenStack work together**

 Ceph Storage Clusters, which are based on Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store (RADOS), can provide back-end storage for OpenStack. This image shows how they work together.
