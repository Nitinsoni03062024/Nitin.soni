title: What Ceph Storage for OpneStack Private Cloud ?
---

> **What is Ceph ?**

 Ceph is an open source project that provides software-defined storage with unified (object, block, and file) storage. You can scale out this storage, and it is self-healing with the ability to anticipate failures.
 
 Ceph is a free, open-source storage platform that operates in a distributed manner, without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely available. Ceph replicates data and makes it fault-tolerant using commodity hardware, thus delivering highly cost-effective storage capabilities

  Ceph is often deployed with OpenStack as a back-end storage method. These two open source projects work together to make a well-integrated and robust solution for infrastructure.

> **How Ceph and OpenStack work together**

 Ceph Storage Clusters, which are based on Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store (RADOS), can provide back-end storage for OpenStack. This image shows how they work together.

 ![From this image we can understand](../images/Ceph-storage-cluster-(RADOS).png)

 OpenStack's Keystone and Swift take advantage of Ceph by using the Ceph Object Gateway (a RADOS Rest Gateway, or RGW). This integration with Keystone allows the gateway to accept Keystone tokens for validation. This same gateway enables Swift to store its objects within Ceph

> **Feature of Ceph**

 1. Self-Managment features
 2. No Vendor lock-in
 3. Power shifted to software layer
 4. No single points of failure
 5. Ceph is Open Source Software
 6. Run as a Commodity hardware
   => Commodity Servers
   => IP Networks
   => HDDs,SDDs,NVME, etc
 7. A single cluster can serve, object block and file workload

 > **Ceph is Scallable**

 1. Ceph is elastic storage infrasture service
   => Storage Cluster may grow and shrink
   => add or remove hardware while system is online and under laod
 2. Scale up with bigger, faster hardware
 3. Scale out within a single cluster for capacity and perfomance

 > **RADOS**

  - Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Storage
    => Common storege layer underpinning object, bloct, block, and file services
  - Provide low-lavel data object storage service 
    => Reliable and high availeble
    => Scallable 
    => Manage all replicas

  > **RADOS Softwate Component**

   1. Cepf Monitor , (Port number 6789 and 330)​
   2. Cepf Manager , (Port number 8443 or 8080)​
   3. Cepf OSD (Object Storage Deamon) , (Port number 6800-7300)

> **1. Cepf Monitor , (Port number 6789 and 330)​**
 
- Central authority for authonication, data placment policy
- Coordination for all cluster components 
- Protect critical cluster state 
- 3 - 7 per cluster

> **2. Cepf Manager , (Port number 8443 or 8080)​**

- Agregate real time metrics (through, disk , cpu uses etc)
- Host all plugable function
- 1 active + 1 standby per cluster

> **3. Cepf OSD (Object Storage Deamon) , (Port number 6800-7300)**

- Store data on HDD and SDD
- Service client IO Request
- 10s to 1000s per cluster 
   
> **What is DHClient ?**

 The Internet Software Consortium DHCP client, dhclient, provides a means for configuring one or more network interfaces using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, BOOTP protocol, or, if these protocols fail, by statically assigning an address.

  File name :- /image/sys_bank/dhclient.cf

> **How to Start and Stop the DHCP Service (Command Line)**

 - To start the DHCP service, # /etc/init.d/dhcp start.
 - To stop the DHCP service,  # /etc/init.d/dhcp stop.

-  **The DHCP daemon stops until it is manually started again, or the system reboots.**
