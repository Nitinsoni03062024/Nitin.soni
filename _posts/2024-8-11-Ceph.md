title: What Ceph Storage for OpneStack Private Cloud ?
---

> **What is Ceph ?**

 Ceph is an open source project that provides software-defined storage with unified (object, block, and file) storage. You can scale out this storage, and it is self-healing with the ability to anticipate failures.
 
 Ceph is a free, open-source storage platform that operates in a distributed manner, without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely available. Ceph replicates data and makes it fault-tolerant using commodity hardware, thus delivering highly cost-effective storage capabilities

  Ceph is often deployed with OpenStack as a back-end storage method. These two open source projects work together to make a well-integrated and robust solution for infrastructure.

> **How Ceph and OpenStack work together**

 Ceph Storage Clusters, which are based on Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store (RADOS), can provide back-end storage for OpenStack. This image shows how they work together.

 OpenStack's Keystone and Swift take advantage of Ceph by using the Ceph Object Gateway (a RADOS Rest Gateway, or RGW). This integration with Keystone allows the gateway to accept Keystone tokens for validation. This same gateway enables Swift to store its objects within Ceph

> **Feature of Ceph**

 1. Self-Managment features
 2. No Vendor lock-in
 3. Power shifted to software layer
 4. No single points of failure
