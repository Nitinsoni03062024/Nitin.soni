> **What is Ceph ?**

 Caph is a software, it will run the oer the OS and support multipule node, this is cluster server storeat to their clients in the from block , file or object level storage.

> **Why We Need Ceph Storage**

1. Scalability
Ceph can scale from a few terabytes to petabytes of data easily.

You can add more disks or nodes without downtime.

2. Fault Tolerance & High Availability
Ceph replicates data across multiple nodes.

Even if a disk or server fails, your data remains safe and accessible.

3. Unified Storage (All-in-One)
Ceph supports:

  => Block storage (like for VMs, OpenStack Cinder)

  => Object storage (like S3, for cloud-native apps)

  => File storage (like NFS or POSIX, for traditional use)

So you don’t need separate systems.

4. Open Source & Cost-Effective
No license cost, unlike NetApp, EMC, etc.

Built for commodity hardware — no vendor lock-in.

5. Self-Healing & Self-Managing
Ceph automatically detects failed disks and re-balances data.

Less manual work for admins.

6. Used in Cloud Environments
Popular in OpenStack as backend storage for Cinder, Glance, and Nova.

> **caph storage key points**

=> open source
=> software define storage
=> distributed
=> it provide storage in the from of block , file and object storage client.

> **What is OSD's ?**

The disks or partitions in our system or server — which we represent in Linux as `/dev/sda` or `/dev/vda` — are where our data is stored. This data can be referred to as files. In Ceph terminology, the data stored on `/dev/sda` is referred to as an OSD (Object Storage Daemon).

> **OSD Type name**

- Primary OSD
- Secondry OSD
- Backup OSD

it is using method => replicas => copy or replicate data from one location to another location,

- Production ENV => 3 way replicate => your one day should be present in 3 location

> **What is primary OSD**

- The disk where the data is first written is called the primary OSD, all read and write operation will be handed by primary OSD

> **What is Secondry OSD**

it will equire role of primary OSD when primary OSD will down,

> **What is Backup OSD**

when secondry OSD dwon, then data will be move in backup OSD and waiting for uping OSD of primary and secondry OSD.
