# About Open Stack

- Platform: Cross-platform software
- Developer: Rackspace Technology
- Initial release: 21 October 2010; 13 years ago

# What is OpenStack

OpenStack is a free, open standard cloud computing platform. It is mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service in both public and private clouds, 
it is piesce of softwate when installed on cluster of phisical server offeres the users to create , run and manage virtial machine on top of it along with support to attach the connected storage atong with the networking services in a virtual formte knwo as a infrastructure as a service (IAAS).

> **OpenStack has 4 principles**

1. Open Soureces
2. Open Design
3. Open Development
4. Open Community

**Bare Metal**

In computer networking, a bare-metal server is a physical computer server that is used by one consumer, or tenant only.

**Approx 40 services is avialebl in OpenStack**

1. **Dashboard Service (HORIZON)** :-

 When we work on any application, the dashboard that we see is what we call horizon in OpenStock. Horizon it's a GUI method of OpenStack service,  

 Dashboard
- Provides simple self service UI for end-users
- Basic cloud administrator functions
- Define users, tenants and quotas
- No infrastructure managemen

2. **Compute Service (NOVA)** 

Nova is the OpenStack project that provides a way provision Compute instance (Aks Virtial Machine), nova support virtial machine, baremetal server and has limited supprt for system containers and nova run as a set of darmons on top of existing linux server to proide that service.

- Compute Nodes â€“ hypervisors that run virtual machines
- Supports multiple hypervisors KVM, Xen, LXC, Hyper-V and ESX
- Distributed controllers that handle scheduling, API calls, etc
- Native OpenStack API and Amazon EC2 compatible API


   > -  **This services is must after nove installtion**

3. **KeyStone :-** Provide identity and authentication for all OpenStack Services
   
4. **Galnce :-** 
   
   This provide the compute iamges repository, all instance launch from glance images

- Image service
- Stores and retrieves disk images (virtual machine templates)
- Supports Raw, QCOW, VMDK, VHD, ISO, OVF & AMI/AKI
- Backend storage : Filesystem, Swift, Gluster, Amazon S3


5. **Neutron :-** This is responable for provisioing the virtual physical network that the compute instacne connecct to on boot,

6. **Placement :-**  This is tracking for inventroy available in a cloud AND assisting which provide og those will be used when creating virtual machine

**How work NOVA**

7. **Block Storage Service (CINDER)**

Block storage, object storage and file storage service is called Cinder in OpenStack.

Block Storage (Volume) Service
- Provides block storage for virtual machines (persistent disks)
- Similar to Amazon EBS service
- Plugin architecture for vendor extensions
eg. NetApp driver for Cinde

8. **Network Service (Neutron)**

Network related all service coming under the network services (neutron)

Network Service 
- Provides framework for Software Defined Network (SDN)
- Plugin architecture 
- Allows integration of hardware and software based network solutions

9. **Image Storge Service (Glance)**

Whenever we launch any instance (VM's), to launch that instance or VM we need an ISO image which we call glance in openstack.

10. **Object Storage Service (Swift)**
   
-  Object Storage service
- Modeled after Amazon's S3 service
- Provides simple service for storing and retrieving arbitrary data
- Native API and S3 compatible API

   Swift service it's a swift service

11.  **Indentity Service (KeyStone)**
   
Keystone is an OpenStack service that provides API client authentication, service discovery, and distributed multi-tenant authorization by implementing OpenStack's Identity AP,

This is a mostinportant service, from the user managment and which service where is runing all over mamanged from keystone service.

1.  **OpenStack Monitoring and Metering (CEILOMETER)**

- Goal: To provide a single infrastructure to collect measurements from an entire OpenStack infrastructure; eliminate need for multiple agents attaching to multiple OpenStack projects
- Primary targets metering and monitoring; 
provides extensibility
